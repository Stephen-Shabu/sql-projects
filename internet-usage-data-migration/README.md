# Overview

In this project I was tasked with to obtain a data set about internet usage in the UK broken down by geographic region between the year 2014 and 2020
As the task involved spending no money on the data, I chose the Office for National Statistics to source the data.

[Internet users - Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/datasets/internetusers)

The dataset contains a lot data on internet usage but the data I needed was about usage broken down by geographic region which was located in table 5A
